# NAME

picocom - minimal dumb-terminal emulation program

# SYNOPSIS

**picocom** [ _options_ ] _device_

# DESCRIPTION

As its name suggests, **picocom(1)** is a minimal dumb-terminal
emulation program. It is, in principle, very much like **minicom(1)**,
only it's "pico" instead of "mini"! It was designed to serve as a
simple, manual, modem configuration, testing, and debugging tool. It
has also served (quite well) as a low-tech serial communications
program to allow access to all types of devices that provide serial
consoles. It could also prove useful in many other similar tasks.

When picocom starts it opens the terminal (serial device) given as its
non-option argument. Unless the **--noinit** option is given, it
configures the device to the settings specified by the
option-arguments (or to some default settings), and sets it to "raw"
mode. If **--noinit** is given, the initialization and configuration is
skipped; the device is just opened. Following this, picocom sets the
standard-input and standard-output to raw mode. Having done so, it
goes in a loop where it listens for input from stdin, or from the
serial port. Input from the serial port is copied to the standard
output while input from the standard input is copied to the serial
port. Picocom also scans its input stream for a user-specified control
character, called the _escape character_ (being by default **C-a**). If
the escape character is seen, then instead of sending it to the
serial-device, the program enters "command mode" and waits for the
next character (which is called the "function character"). Depending
on the value of the function character, picocom performs one of the
operations described in the **[COMMANDS]** section below.

# COMMANDS

Commands are given to picocom by first keying the *espace character*
which by default is **C-a** (see **[OPTIONS]** below for how to change
it), and then keying one of the function (command) characters shown
here.

*escape character*

:   Send the escape character to the serial port and return to
    "transparent" mode. This means that if the escape character
    (**C-a**, by default) is typed twice, the program sends the escape
    character to the serial port, and remains in transparent mode.

**C-x**

:   Exit the program: if the **--noreset** option was not given then
    the serial port is reset to its original settings before exiting;
    if it was given the serial port is not reset.

**C-q**

:   Quit the program _without_ resetting the serial port, regardless of
    the **--noreset** option.

**C-p**

:   Pulse the DTR line. Lower it for 1 sec, and then raise it again.

**C-t**

:   Toggle the DTR line. If DTR is up, then lower it. If it is down,
    then raise it.

**C-g**

:   Toggle the RTS line. If RTS is up, then lower it. If it is down,
    then raise it. Not supported if the flow control mode is RTS/CTS.
    Only supported in Linux and OSX.

**C-backslash**

:   Generate a break sequence on the serial line. A break sequence is
    usually generated by marking (driving to logical one) the serial
    Tx line for an amount of time coresponding to several character
    durations.

**C-b**

:   Set baudrate. Prompts you to enter a baudrate numerically (in bps)
    and configures the serial port accordingly.

**C-u**

:   Baud up. Increase the baud-rate. The list of baud-rates
    stepped-through by this command is: 50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 200,
    300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200.  If
    `HIGH_BAUD` support is compiled-in, then the following baud-rates
    are also added to the list: 230400, 460800, 500000, 576000,
    921600, 1000000, 1152000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000, 3000000,
    3500000, 4000000. Depending on you system, any of the higher baud
    rates may be missing.

**C-d**

:   Baud down. Decrease the baud-rate. The list of baud-rates
    stepped-through by this command is the same as for the "baud-up"
    command.

**C-f**

:   Cycle through flow-control settings (RTS/CTS, XON/XOFF, none).

**C-y**

:   Cycle through parity settings (even, odd, none).

**C-i**

:   Cycle through databits-number settings (5, 6, 7, 8).

**C-j**

:   Cycle through stopbits-number settings (1, 2).

**C-c**

:   Toggle local-echo mode.

**C-v**

:   Show program options (like baud rate, data bits, etc) as well as
    the actual serial port settings. Only the options and port
    settings that can be modified online (through commands) are shown,
    not those that can only be set at the command-line. See
    **[DISPLAY OF OPTIONS AND PORT SETTINGS]** for details.

**C-h** or **C-k**

:   Show help or show keys. Prints a short description of all
    available function (command) keys.

**C-s**

:   Send (upload) a file. See **[SENDING AND RECEIVING FILES]**
    below.

**C-r**

:   Receive (download) a file. See **[SENDING AND RECEIVING FILES]**
    below.

After performing one of the above operations, the program leaves the
command mode and enters transparent mode. Example: To increase the
baud-rate by two steps, you have to type:

> **C-a**, **C-u**, **C-a**, **C-u**

assuming of-course that **C-a** is the escape character.

# OPTIONS

Picocom accepts the following command-line options.

**--baud** | **-b**

:   Defines the baud-rate to set the serial-port (terminal) to.

**--flow** | **-f**

:   Defines the flow-control mode to set the serial-port to. Must be
    one of: **x** for xon/xoff (software) mode, **h** for hardware
    flow control (RTS/CTS), **n** for no flow control. (Default:
    **n**)

**--parity** | **-y**

:   Defines the parity mode to set the serial-port to.  Must be one
    of: **o** for odd parity mode, **e** for even parity mode, **n**
    for no parity mode. (Default: **n**)

**--databits** | **-d**

:   Defines the number of data bits in every character. Must be one
    of: **5**, **6**, **7**, **8**. (Default: **8**)

**--stopbits** | **-p**

:   Defines the number of stop bits in every character. Must be one
    of: **1**, or **2**. (Default: **1**)

**--escape** | **-e**

:   Defines the character that will make picocom enter command-mode
    (see description above). If **x** is given, then **C-x** will make
    picocom enter command mode. (Default: **a**)

**--echo** | **-c**

:   Enable local echo. Every character being read from the terminal
    (standard input) is echoed to the terminal (standard output)
    subject to the echo-mapping configuration (see **--emap**
    option). (Default: Disabled)

**--noinit** | **-i**

:   If given, picocom will not initialize, reset, or otherwise meddle
    with the serial port at start-up. It will just open it. This is
    useful, for example, for connecting picocom to already-connected
    modems, or already configured ports without terminating the
    connection, or altering the settings. If required, serial port
    parameters can then be adjusted at run-time by commands.
    (Default: Disabled)

**--noreset** | **-r**

:   If given, picocom will not reset the serial port when exiting. It
    will just close the filedes and do nothing more. This is useful,
    for example, for leaving modems connected when exiting
    picocom. Regardless whether the **--noreset** option is given, the
    user can exit picocom using the "Quit" command (instead of
    "Exit"), which never resets the serial port. If **--noreset** is
    given then "Quit" and "Exit" behave essentially the
    same. (Default: Disabled)

**--nolock** | **-l**

:   If given, picocom will _not_ attempt to lock the serial port
    before opening it. Normally, depending on how it's compiled,
    picocom attempts to get a UUCP-style lock-file
    (e.g. '/var/lock/LCK..ttyS0') before opening the port, or attempts
    to lock the port device-node using **flock(2)**. Failing to do so,
    results in the program exiting after emitting an error-message. It
    is possible that your picocom binary is compiled without support
    for locking. In this case the **--nolock** option is accepted, but
    has no effect. (Default: Disabled)

**--send-cmd** | **-s**

:   Specifies the external program (and any arguments to it) that will
    be used for transmitting files. If the argument to **--send-cmd**
    is the empty string (''), the send-file command is disabled. See
    **[SENDING AND RECEIVING FILES]**. (Default: **sz -vv**)

**--receive-cmd** | **-v**

:   Specifies the external program (and any arguments to it) that will
    be used for receiving files. If the argument to **--receive-cmd**
    is the empty string (''), the receive-file command is
    disabled. See **[SENDING AND RECEIVING FILES]**. (Default: **rz
    -vv**)

**--imap**

:   Specifies the input character map (i.e. special characters to be
    replaced when read from the serial port). See
    **[INPUT, OUTPUT, AND ECHO MAPPING]**. (Defaul: Empty)

**--omap**

:   Specifies the output character map (i.e. special characters to be
    replaced before being written to serial port). See
    **[INPUT, OUTPUT, AND ECHO MAPPING]**. (Defaul: Empty)

**--emap**

:   Specifies the local-echo character map (i.e. special characters to
    be replaced before being echoed-back to the terminal, if
    local-echo is enabled). See
    **[INPUT, OUTPUT, AND ECHO MAPPING]**. (Defaul: **delbs,crcrlf**)

**--logfile** | **-g**

:   Use specified file for logging (recording) serial input, and
    possibly serial output. If the file exists, it is appended to.
    Every character read from the serial port is written to the
    specified file (before input mapping is performed). If local-echo
    mode is is enabled (see **--echo** option and **C-c** command),
    then every character written to the serial port (after output
    mapping is performed) is also logged to the same file. (Default:
    no logging)

**--lower-rts**

:   Lower the RTS control signal after opening the serial port (by
    default RTS is raised after open). Only supported when
    flow-control mode is not set to RTS/CTS, ignored otherwise. Only
    supported in Linux and OSX.

**--lower-dtr**

:   Lower the DTR control signal after opening the serial port (by
    default DTR is raised after open).  Only supported in Linux and
    OSX.

**--help** | **-h**

:   Print a short help message describing the command-line
    options. Picocom's version, ompile-time options, and enabled
    features are also shown.


# DISPLAY OF OPTIONS AND PORT SETTINGS

The "show program options" command (**C-v**), as well as the commands
that change program options (**C-b**, **C-u**, **C-d**, **C-f**, etc)
print messages showing the current values (or the new values, if they
were changed) for the respective options. If picocom determines that
an actual serial-port setting differs from the current value of the
respective option (for whatever reason), then the value of the option
is shown followed by the value of the actual serial-port setting in
parenthesis. Example:

    *** baud: 115200 (9600)

This means that a baud rate of 115200bps has been selected (from the
command line, or using commands that change the baudrate) but the
serial-port is actually operating at 9600bps (the driver may not
support the higher setting, and has silently replaced it with a safe
default, or the setting may have been changed from outside
picocom). If the option and the corresponding serial-port setting are
the same, only a single value is shown. Example:

    *** baud: 9600

This behavior was introduced in picocom 2.0. Older releases displayed
only the option values, not the actual serial-port settings
corresponding to them.


# SENDING AND RECEIVING FILES

Picocom can send and receive files over the serial port using external
programs that implement the respective protocols. In Linux typical
programs for this purpose are:

- **rx(1)** - receive using the X-MODEM protocol
- **rb(1)** - receive using the Y-MODEM protocol
- **rz(1)** - receive using the Z-MODEM protocol
- **sx(1)** - send using the X-MODEM protocol
- **sb(1)** -  send using the Y-MODEM protocol
- **sz(1)** - send using the Z-MODEM protocol
- **ascii-xfr(1)** - receive or transmit ASCII files

The name of, and the command-line options to, the program to be used
for transmitting files are given by the **--send-cmd**
option. Similarly the program to receive files, and its arguments, are
given by the **--receive-cmd** option. For example, in order to start
a picocom session that uses **sz(1)** to transmit files, and **rz(1)**
to receive files, you have to say something like this:

    picocom --send-cmd "sz -vv" --receive-cmd "rz -vv" ...

If the argument to the **-send-cmd** option, or the argument to the
**--receive-cmd** option is the empty string, then the respective
command is disabled. For example, in order to disable both the "send"
and the "receive" commands you can invoke picocom like this:

    picocom --send-cmd '' --receive-cmd '' ...

A picocom session with both, the send- and the receive-file commands
disabled does not **fork(2)** and does not run any external programs.

During the picocom session, if you key the "send" or "receive"
commands (e.g. by pressing **C-a**, **C-s**, or **C-a**, **C-r**) you
will be prompted for a filename. At this prompt you can enter one or
more file-names, and any additional arguments to the transmission or
reception program. Command-line editing and rudimentary pathname
completion are available at this prompt, if you have compiled picocom
with support for the linenoise library. Pressing **C-c** at this
prompt will cancel the file transfer command and return to normal
picocom operation. After entering a filename (and / or additional
transmission or reception program arguments) and assuming you have not
canceled the operation by pressing **C-c**, picocom will start the
external program as specified by the **--send-cmd**, or
**--receive-cmd** option, and with any filenames and additional
arguments you may have supplied. The standard input and output of the
external program will be connected to the serial port. The standard
error of the external program will be connected to the terminal
which---while the program is running---will revert to canonical
mode. Pressing **C-c** while the external program is running will
prematurely terminate it (assuming that the program itself does not
ignore SIGINT), and return control to picocom. Pressing **C-c** at any
other time, has no special effect; the character is normally passed to
the serial port.


# INPUT, OUTPUT, AND ECHO MAPPING

Using the **--imap**, **--omap**, and **--emap** options you can make
picocom map (translate, replace) certain special characters after being
read from the serial port (with **--imap**), before being written to
the serial port (with **--omap**), and before being locally echoed to
the terminal (standard output) if local echo is enabled (with
**--emap**). These mapping options take, each, a single argument which
is a comma-separated list of one or more of the following identifiers:

- **crlf** (map CR to LF),
- **crcrlf** (map CR to CR + LF),
- **igncr** (ignore CR),
- **lfcr** (map LF to CR),
- **lfcrlf** (map LF to CR + LF),
- **ignlf** (ignore LF),
- **bsdel** (map BS to DEL),
- **delbs** (map DEL to BS)

For example the command:

    picocom --omap crlf,delbs --imap ignlf,bsdel --emap crcrlf ...

will:

- Replace every CR (carriage return, 0x0d) character with LF (line
  feed, 0x0a) and every DEL (delete, 0x7f) character with BS
  (backspace, 0x08) before writing it to the serial port.

- Ignore (not write to the terminal) every LF character read from the
  serial port, and replace every BS character read from the serial
  port with DEL.

- Replace every CR character with CR and LF when echoing to the
  terminal (if local-echo is enabled).
