 *
 * Simple terminal management library. Wraps termios(3), and
 * simplifies the logistics required for the reliable management and
 * control of terminals.
 *
 * Principles of operation:
 *
 * After the library is initialized, one or more file-descriptors can
 * be added to (and latter removed from) the list managed by the
 * it. These file descriptors must be opened on terminal devices. For
 * every fd, the original settings of the associated terminal device
 * are saved by the library. These settings are restored when the fd
 * is removed from the framework, or at program termination [by means
 * of an atexit(3) handler installed by the library], or at user
 * request. The library maintains three structures for every fd in the
 * framework: The original settings structure ("origtermios"), keeping
 * the settings of the terminal device when the respective filedes was
 * added to the framework. The current settings structure
 * ("currtermios"), keeping the current settings of the associated
 * terminal device; and the next settings structure ("nexttermios")
 * which keeps settings to be applied to the associated terminal
 * device at a latter time, upon user request.  The "term_set_*"
 * functions can be used to modify the device settings stored in the
 * nexttermios structure. Using functions provided by the library the
 * user can: Apply the nexttermios settings to the device. Revert all
 * changes made on nexttermios by copying the currtermios structure to
 * nexttermios. Reset the device, by configuring it to the original
 * settings, and copying origtermios to currtermios and
 * nexttermios. Refresh the device by rereading the current settings
 * from it and updating currtermios (to catch up with changes made to
 * the device by means outside of this framework).
