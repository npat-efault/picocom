 *
 * Simple terminal management library. Wraps termios(3), and
 * simplifies the logistics required for the reliable management and
 * control of terminals.
 *
 * Principles of operation:
 *
 * After the library is initialized one or more file-descriptors, can
 * be added to (and latter removed from) the list managed by the
 * library (framework). These file descriptors must be opened on
 * terminal devices. For every fd, the original settings of the
 * associated terminal device are saved by the library. These settings
 * are restored when the fd is removed from the framework, or at
 * program termination [by means of an atexit(3) handler installed by
 * the library], or at user request. The library maintains three
 * structures for every fd in the framework: The original settings
 * structure ("origtermios"), keeping the settings of the terminal
 * device when the respective filedes was added to the framework. The
 * current settings structure ("currtermios"), keeping the current
 * settings of the associated terminal device; and the next settings
 * structure ("nexttermios") which keeps settings to be applied to the
 * associated terminal device at a latter time, upon user request.
 * The "term_set_*" functions can be used to modify the device
 * settings stored in the nexttermios structure. Using functions
 * provided by the library the user can: Apply the nexttermios
 * settings to the device. Revert all changes made on nexttermios by
 * copying the currtermios structure to nexttermios. Reset the device,
 * by configuring it to the original settings, and copying origtermios
 * to currtermios and nexttermios. Refresh the device by rereading the
 * current settings from it and updating currtermios (to catch up with
 * changes made to the device by means outside of this framework).
 *
