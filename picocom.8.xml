  <description>

    <p>
      As its name suggests, <b>picocom</b> is a minimal
      dumb-terminal emulation program. It is, in principle, very much
      like <manref name="minicom" section="1"/>, only it's "pico"
      instead of "mini"! It was designed to serve as a simple, manual,
      modem configuration, testing, and debugging tool. It has also
      served (quite well) as a low-tech "terminal-window" to allow
      operator intervention in PPP connection scripts (something like
      the ms-windows "open terminal window before / after dialing"
      feature). It could also prove useful in many other similar
      tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
      When <b>picocom</b> starts it opens the terminal (serial
      device) given as its non-option argument. Unless the
      <opt>--noinit</opt> option is given, it configures the device to
      the settings specified by the option-arguments (or to some
      default settings), and sets it to "raw" mode. If
      <opt>--noinit</opt> is given, the initialization and
      configuration is skipped; the device is just opened. Following
      this, <b>picocom</b> sets the standard-input and
      standard-output to raw mode. Having done so, it goes in a loop
      where it listens for input from stdin, or from the serial
      port. Input from the serial port is copied to the standard
      output while input from the standard input is copied to the
      serial port. <b>picocom</b> also scans its input stream for
      a user-specified control character, called the "escape
      character" (being by default "C-a"). If the escape character is
      seen, then instead of sending it to the serial-device, the
      program enters "command mode" and waits for the next character
      (which is called the "function character"). Depending on the
      value of the function character, <b>picocom</b> performs one
      of the operations described in the "Commands" section below.
    </p>
  </description>
  
  <section name="COMMANDS">

    <p>
      Commands are given to <b>picocom</b> by first keying the "espace
      character" which by default is "C-a" (see "Options" below on how
      to change it), and then keying one for the function (command)
      characters shown here.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      [escape character]: Send the escape character to the serial port
      and return to "transparent" mode. This means that if the escape
      character ("C-a", by default) is typed twice, the program sends
      the escape character to the serial port, and remains in
      transparent mode.
    </p>

    <p>
      [C-x]: Exit the program: if the <opt>--noreset</opt> option was
      not given then the serial port is reset to its original settings
      before exiting; if it was given the serial port is not reset.
    </p>

    <p>
      [C-q]: Quit the program *without* reseting the serial port,
      regardless of the <opt>--noreset</opt> option.
    </p>
	
    <p>
      [C-p]: Pulse the DTR line. Lower it for 1 sec, and then raise it
      again.
    </p>

    <p>
      [C-t]: Toggle the DTR line. If DTR is up, then lower it. If it
      is down, then raise it.
    </p>

    <p>
      [C-backslash]: Generate a break sequence on the serial line. A
      break sequence is usually generated by marking (driving to
      logical one) the serial Tx line for an amount of time
      coresponding to several character durations.
    </p>

    <p>
      [C-u]: Baud up. Increase the baud-rate. The list of baud-rates
      stepped-through by this command is: 50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 200,
      300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600,
      115200. If HIGH_BAUD support is compiled in, then the following
      baud-rates are also added to the list: 230400, 460800, 500000,
      576000, 921600, 1000000, 1152000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000,
      3000000, 3500000, 4000000. Depending on you system, any of the
      higher baud rates may be missing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      [C-d]: Baud down. Decrease the baud-rate. The list of baud-rates
      stepped-through by this command is the same as for the "baud-up"
      command.
    </p>

    <p>
      [C-f]: Cycle through flow-control settings (RTS/CTS, XON/XOFF,
      none).
    </p>

    <p>
      [C-y]: Cycle through parity settings (even, odd, none).
    </p>

    <p>
      [C-b]: Cycle through databits-number settings (5, 6, 7, 8).
    </p>

    <p>
      [C-c]: Toggle local-echo mode.
    </p>

    <p>
      [C-v]: Show program options (like baud rate, data bits, etc) as
      well as the actual serial port settings. Only the options and
      port settings that can be modified online (through commands) are
      shown, not those that can only be set at the command-line. If an
      actual port setting is different than the current value of the
      respective option (for whatever reason) then the value of the
      option is shown, followed by the value of the actual port
      setting in parenthesis. Example: "*** baud: 115200 (9600)". This
      means that a baud rate of 115200bps has been selected (from the
      command line, or using commands) but the serial port is actually
      operating at 9600bps (the driver may not support the higher
      setting, and has silently replaced it with a safe default, or
      the setting may have been changed from outside picocom). If the
      option and the corresponding port setting are the same, only a
      single value is shown. Example: "*** baud: 9600".
    </p>

    <p>
      [C-s]: Send (upload) a file (see "Sending and Receiving Files"
      below)
    </p>
      
    <p>
      [C-r]: Receive (download) a file (see "Sending and Receiving
      Files" below)
    </p>

    <p>
      After performing one of the above operations the program leaves
      the command mode and enters transparent mode. Example: To
      increase the baud-rate by two steps, you have to type:
    </p>
    <p>
      C-a, C-u, C-a, C-u
    </p>
    <p>
      assuming of-course that "C-a" is the escape character.
    </p>

    <p> 
      Commands that change program options ([C-u], [C-d], [C-f], etc)
      also display a message showing the new option value. If the new
      option value cannot be applied succesfully to the serial port
      (for whatever reason), then the respective actual current port
      setting is also shown. See the description of the [C-v] command,
      above, for more on this.

  <section name = "SENDING AND RECEIVING FILES">
    <p>
      <b>picocom</b> can send and receive files over the serial port
      using external programs that implement the respective
      protocols. In Linux typical programs for this purpose are:
    </p>

     <p><manref name="rx" section="1"/> 
     - receive using the X-MODEM protocol</p>
     <p><manref name="rb" section="1"/> 
     - receive using the Y-MODEM protocol</p>
     <p><manref name="rz" section="1"/> 
     - receive using the Z-MODEM protocol</p>
     <p><manref name="sx" section="1"/> 
     - send using the X-MODEM protocol</p>
     <p><manref name="sb" section="1"/> 
     - send using the Y-MODEM protocol</p>
     <p><manref name="sz" section="1"/> 
     - send using the Z-MODEM protocol</p>
     <p><manref name="ascii-xfr" section="1"/> 
     - receive or transmit ASCII files</p>
    
    <p>
      The name of, and the command-line options to, the program to be
      used for transmitting files are given by the
      <opt>--send-cmd</opt> option. Similarly the program to receive
      files, and its argumets, are given by the
      <opt>--receive-cmd</opt> option. For example, in order to start
      a <b>picocom</b> session that uses "sz" to transmit files, and
      "rz" to receive files, you have to say something like this:
    </p>

    <p>
      picocom --send-cmd "sz -vv" --receive-cmd "rz -vv"
    </p>

    <p>
      If the argument to the <opt>--send-cmd</opt> option, or the
      argument to the <opt>--receive-cmd</opt> option is the empty
      string, then the respective command is disabled. For example, in
      order to disable both the "send" and the "receive" commands you
      can invoke picocom like this:
    </p>

    <p>
      picocom --send-cmd '' --receive-cmd ''
    </p>

    <p>
      During the picocom session, if you key the "send" or "receive"
      commands (e.g. by pressing C-a, C-s, or C-a, C-r) you will be
      prompted for a filename. At this prompt you can enter one or
      more file-names, and any additional arguments to the
      transmission or reception program. Command-line editing and
      pathname completion are available at this prompt, if you have
      compiled picocom with support for the linenoise
      library. Pressing 'C-c' at this prompt will cancel the file
      transfer command and return to normal <b>picocom</b>
      operation. After entering a filename (and / or additional
      transmission or reception program arguments) and assuming you
      have not canceled the operation by pressing C-c, picocom will
      start the the external program as specified by the
      <opt>--send-cmd</opt>, or <opt>--receive-cmd</opt> option, and
      with any filenames and additional arguments you may have
      supplied. The standard input and output of the external program
      will be connected to the serial port. The standard error of the
      external program will be connected to the terminal which---while
      the program is running---will revert to canonical mode. Pressing
      'C-c' while the external program is running will prematurely
      terminate it, and return control to <b>picocom</b>. Pressing
      'C-c' at any other time, has no special effect; the character is
      normally passed to the serial port.
    </p>
      
  </section>

  <section name = "INPUT, OUTPUT, AND ECHO MAPPING">
    <p>
      Using the <opt>--imap</opt>, <opt>--omap</opt>, and
      <opt>--emap</opt> options you can make <b>picocom</b> map
      (tranlate, replace) certain special characters after being read
      from the serial port (with <opt>--imap</opt>), before being
      written to the serial port (with <opt>--omap</opt>), and before
      being locally echoed to the terminal (standard output) if local
      echo is enabled (with <opt>--emap</opt>). These mapping options
      take, each, a single argument which is a comma-separated list of
      one or more of the following identifiers: "crlf" (map CR to LF),
      "crcrlf" (map CR to CR + LF), "igncr" (ignore CR), "lfcr" (map
      LF to CR), "lfcrlf" (map LF to CR + LF), "ignlf" (ignore LF),
      "bsdel" (map BS --> DEL), "delbs" (map DEL --> BS)
    </p>

    <p>
      For example the command:
    </p>
    <p>
      picocom --omap crlf,delbs --imap inglf,bsdel --emap crcrlf ...
    </p>
    <p>
      will: Replace every CR (carriage return, 0x0d) caracter with LF
      (line feed, 0x0a) and every DEL (delete, 0x7f) character with BS
      (backspace, 0x08) before writing it to the serial port. Ignore
      (not write to the terminal) every LF character read from the
      serial port and replace every BS character read from the serial
      port with DEL. Replace every CR character with CR and LF when
      echoing to the terminal (if local-echo is enabled).
    </p>

    </option>
    
    <option>
      <opt><p>--echo | -c</p></opt>
      <optdesc>
	<p>
	  Enable local echo. Every character being read from the

	  (standard output) subject to the echo-mapping configuration
	  (see <opt>--emap</opt> option. (Default: Disabled)

    </option>
    
    <option>
      <opt><p>--noinit | -i</p></opt>
      <optdesc>
	<p>
	  If given, <b>picocom</b> will not initialize, reset, or
	  otherwise meddle with the serial port at start-up. It will
	  just open it. This is useful, for example, for connecting
	  <b>picocom</b> to already-connected modems, or already
	  configured ports without terminating the connection, or
	  altering the settings. If required serial port parameters
	  can then be adjusted at run-time by commands.
	</p>
      </optdesc>
    </option>
    
    <option>
      <opt><p>--noreset | -r</p></opt>
      <optdesc>
	<p>
	  If given, <b>picocom</b> will not *reset* the serial port
	  when exiting. It will just close the filedes and do nothing
	  more. This is useful, for example, for leaving modems
	  connected when exiting <b>picocom</b>. Regardless whether
	  the <opt>--noreset</opt> option is given the user can exit
	  <b>picocom</b> using the "Quit" command (instead of "Exit"),
	  which never resets the serial port. If <opt>--noreset</opt>
	  is given then "Quit" and "Exit" behave essentially the same.
	</p>
      </optdesc>
    </option>
    
    <option>
      <opt><p>--nolock | -l</p></opt>
      <optdesc>
	<p>
	  If given, <b>picocom</b> will *not* attempt to lock the
	  serial port before opening it. Normally, depending on how
	  it's compiled, picocom attempts to get a UUCP-style
	  lock-file (e.g. "/var/lock/LCK..ttyS0") before opening the
	  port, or attempts to lock the port device-node using <manref
	  name="flock" section="2"/>. Failing to do so, results in the
	  program exiting after emitting an error-message. It is
	  possible that your picocom binary is compiled without
	  support for locking. In this case the <opt>--nolock</opt>
	  option is accepted, but has no effect.
